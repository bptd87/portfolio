    content: "As a scenic designer, I've found myself at the crossroads of tradition and innovation. AI tools have burst onto the scene, but Sora stands apart as something uniquely suited to theatrical visualization. Many of my colleagues are understandably cautious—worried that the human touch and collaborative spirit that define our craft might be diluted by automated shortcuts."

    content: "I share those concerns. Yet I can't ignore how the landscape is shifting around us. In architectural visualization and commercial production, AI is already becoming standard practice. Detailed 3D modeling that once took days in Cinema 4D or Unreal Engine is increasingly being replaced by faster, AI-driven alternatives—not because they're better, but because they're more economical and efficient."

    content: "What makes Sora different is its remarkable ability to understand and transform existing images. Unlike tools like Midjourney that excel at generating images from text descriptions, Sora can take a designer's original rendering and enhance it while maintaining the core design elements. This image-to-image capability is revolutionary for designers who already have visualization skills but want to elevate their presentations without starting from scratch."

    content: "As freelance designers increasingly work on hourly rates, clients are less willing to pay for time-intensive modeling and rendering. That reality saddens me—those meticulous stages of creation are part of what I love about design. But it's also prompted me to explore: how might we adapt without losing the essence of what makes us designers?"

    content: "Before diving into my experiments, it's worth highlighting what makes Sora distinctive in the AI landscape. Unlike Gigapixel AI, which enhances resolution but often produces unpredictable results and requires significant time investment, Sora offers more creative control while maintaining reasonable processing speeds. Though not as lightning-fast as Midjourney, Sora's learning curve is considerably gentler—especially for designers who already think visually rather than textually."
  },
  {
    id: 'block-1767777830573-6',
    type: 'paragraph',
    content: "The key difference is Sora's image-to-image workflow. While most AI tools require you to build an image from scratch using text prompts alone, Sora excels at taking existing design work and transforming it in ways that preserve the designer's intent. This means you can start with your own sketches, renderings, or photographs and enhance them rather than replacing them with AI-generated alternatives."

The actor portraying Archbishop Óscar Romero must remain standing on the platform, not in front of or behind it, and centered within the triangle as shown.Apply cinematic, theatrical lighting with rich shadows and directional highlights that maintain a sense of atmosphere and depth without obscuring detail. Think stage lighting with dramatic clarity.There are three projection screens in the design—enhance them to look like realistic theatrical projections, including soft glow, fabric texture, and visible projection light diffusion. Do not move or scale the screens.The stage curtains on either side should be rendered with photorealistic fabric depth, folds, and interaction with theatrical lighting—without changing their position or coverage.Keep the yellow floor markings, ground texture, and triangle structure exactly as designed. Enhance realism only through subtle texture improvements—dust, scuffs, and theatrical floor detail.This is a fixed scenic design rendering, so all scenic elements must retain their original spatial relationships.
